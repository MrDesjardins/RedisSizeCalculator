# Redis Key Size Calculator CSV

This is a fork from https://github.com/abhiyx/RedisSizeCalculator

This fork difference is:
	- Faster output
	- CSV format

As the original, you need to configure the ip and port in the source code. However, the output is in the Bin folder in CSV which can be open by Excel easily.
